## 🚀 What It Does

JuiceMixer 3000 is a Python script that:

- Randomly picks 2–3 fruits from a list
- Suggests a new juice combo
- Adds a little *flavor text* like "A zesty kick in every sip!"

Perfect if you're bored, coding late at night, or pretending to be productive while secretly daydreaming about fruit juice.
